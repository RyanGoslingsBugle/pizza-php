# Pizza-PHP

A simple PHP site created for a university development course. Uses client-side JS for menu/order management, so absolutely no use in production unless you want smart cookies changing all the prices.

Admin interface can be reached at /admin

## Requirements

Needs two additional files - config/db.php and config/db-bootstrap.php

See templates currently in directory, plug in your own values and you're good to go.
